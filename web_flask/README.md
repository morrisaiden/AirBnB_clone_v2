sk is a micro web framework written in Python, designed to be lightweight, flexible, and easy to use. Here are some key aspects of Flask:

Key Features of Flask
Micro Framework:

Flask is considered a micro framework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.
Minimalist and Extensible:

Flask is designed to be simple and minimalistic, allowing developers to add only the components they need. It can be extended with a variety of plugins, known as Flask extensions, which add functionality such as database integration, form handling, and authentication.
Routing:

Flask uses a simple and intuitive routing system to map URLs to Python functions. This makes it easy to define the endpoints of your web application.
Template Engine:

Flask integrates with the Jinja2 template engine, which allows developers to build dynamic HTML pages using templates. Jinja2 is powerful and flexible, enabling the use of logic within HTML templates.
WSGI Compatibility:

Flask is based on the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI), a standard interface between web servers and Python web applications or frameworks. This makes it compatible with various WSGI servers.
Development Server and Debugger:

Flask includes a built-in development server and debugger, making it easy to test applications during development. The debugger provides detailed error messages and an interactive debugger if an error occurs.
RESTful Request Dispatching:

Flask supports the creation of RESTful APIs, making it straightforward to build web services with JSON responses and other web-friendly data formats.
Lightweight and Fast:

Because Flask includes only the essential components, it is lightweight and fast. This makes it suitable for small to medium-sized projects and for developers who prefer to have control over the components they use.
Community and Documentation:

Flask has a large, active community and excellent documentation, which includes tutorials, guides, and a comprehensive API reference. This makes it easy to get started and find help when needed.
Use Cases for Flask
Simple Web Applications: Ideal for small to medium-sized web applications that do not require the overhead of a full-stack framework.
APIs and Microservices: Excellent for building RESTful APIs and microservices due to its simplicity and flexibility.
Prototyping: Perfect for quickly creating prototypes and proof-of-concept applications because of its straightforward and minimalistic design.
Educational Purposes: Great for learning web development concepts and Python because of its clear and concise syntax.
